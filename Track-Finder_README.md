# PHP-Files

Track-Finder.net was a website I created for the purpose of building a CMS from scratch using only core PHP and no extra libraries or frameworks. 
The idea behind the site was to provide Mountainbikers with a platform to submit and find new tracks and trails they could use. I built this with PHP because I wanted to enhance my PHP skills. Building the site without the use of extra frameworks or Libraries enables me to do this.
